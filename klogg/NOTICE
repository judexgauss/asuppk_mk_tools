This product includes code from XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>
liblzma that is in the public domain.

> XZ Utils Licensing
> ==================
> 
>     Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
>     is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
>     package (but check the individual files to be sure!):
> 
>       - liblzma is in the public domain.
> 
>       - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
>         domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
>         in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
>         GNU LGPLv2.1+.
> 
>       - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
>         adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
>         under GNU GPLv2+.
> 
>       - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
>         XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
>         are in the public domain.
> 
>       - Translated messages are in the public domain.
> 
>       - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
>         are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
>         in the binaries being built.
> 
>       - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
>         utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.
> 
>       - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
>         that are under various free software licenses.
> 
>     You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
>     the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
>     take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
>     the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
>     lawyers.
> 
>     As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
> 
>     If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
>     into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
>     polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
>     naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
>     notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:
> 
>         This software includes code from XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>.
> 
>     The following license texts are included in the following files:
>       - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
>       - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
>       - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3
> 
>     Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
>     pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
>     binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
>     even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
>     package.
> 
>     If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
>     information.
